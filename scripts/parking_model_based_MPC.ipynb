    "# Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle\n",
    "We consider the optimal control problem of an MDP with a **known** reward function $R$ and subject to **unknown deterministic** dynamics $s_{t+1} = f(s_t, a_t)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\max_{(a_0,a_1,\\dotsc)} \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t R(s_t,a_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In **model-based reinforcement learning**, this problem is solved in **two steps**:\n",
    "1. **Model learning**:\n",
    "We learn a model of the dynamics $f_\\theta \\simeq f$ through regression on interaction data.\n",
    "2. **Planning**:\n",
    "We leverage the dynamics model $f_\\theta$ to compute the optimal trajectory $$\\max_{(a_0,a_1,\\dotsc)} \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t R(\\hat{s}_t,a_t)$$ following the learnt dynamics $\\hat{s}_{t+1} = f_\\theta(\\hat{s}_t, a_t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We can easily extend to unknown rewards and stochastic dynamics, but we consider the simpler case in this notebook for ease of presentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sparse rewards\n",
    "* In model-free reinforcement learning, we only obtain a reinforcement signal when encountering rewards. In environment with **sparse rewards**, the chance of obtaining a reward randomly is **negligible**, which prevents any learning.\n",
    "* However, even in the **absence of rewards** we still receive a **stream of state transition data**. We can exploit this data to learn about the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity of the policy/value vs dynamics:\n",
    "Is it easier to decide which action is best, or to predict what is going to happen?\n",
    "* Some problems can have **complex dynamics** but a **simple optimal policy or value function**. For instance, consider the problem of learning to swim. Predicting the movement requires understanding fluid dynamics and vortices while the optimal policy simply consists in moving the limbs in sync.\n",
    "* Conversely, other problems can have **simple dynamics** but **complex policies/value functions**. Think of the game of Go, its rules are simplistic (placing a stone merely changes the board state at this location) but the corresponding optimal policy is very complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, model-free RL should be applied to the first category of problems and model-based RL to the second category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inductive bias\n",
    "Oftentimes, real-world problems exhibit a particular **structure**: for instance, any problem involving motion of physical objects will be **continuous**. It can also be **smooth**, **invariant** to translations, etc. This knowledge can then be incorporated in machine learning models to foster efficient learning. In contrast, there can often be **discontinuities** in the policy decisions or value function: e.g. think of a collision vs near-collision state.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Sample efficiency\n",
    "Overall, it is generally recognized that model-based approaches tend to **learn faster** than model-free techniques (see e.g. [[Sutton, 1990]](http://papersdb.cs.ualberta.ca/~papersdb/uploaded_files/paper_p160-sutton.pdf.stjohn)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretability\n",
    "In real-world applications, we may want to know **how a policy will behave before actually executing it**, for instance for **safety-check** purposes. However, model-free reinforcement learning only recommends which action to take at current time without being able to predict its consequences. In order to obtain the trajectory, we have no choice but executing the policy. In stark contrast, model-based methods a more interpretable in the sense that we can probe the policy for its intended (and predicted) trajectory."

    "## Our challenge: Automated Parking System\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the **parking-v0** task of the [highway-env](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env) environment. It is a **goal-conditioned continuous control** task where an agent **drives a car** by controlling the gaz pedal and steering angle and must **park in a given location** with the appropriate heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "This MDP has several properties which justifies using model-based methods:\n",
    "* The policy/value is highly dependent on the goal which adds a significant level of complexity to a model-free learning process, whereas the dynamics are completely independent of the goal and hence can be simpler to learn.\n",
    "* In the context of an industrial application, we can reasonably expect for safety concerns that the planned trajectory is required to be known in advance, before execution.\n",

    "### Model bias\n",
    "\n",
    "In model-based reinforcement learning, we replace our original optimal control problem by another problem: optimizing our learnt approximate MDP. When settling for this approximate MDP to plan with, we introduce a **bias** that can only **decrease the true performance** of the corresponding planned policy. This is called the problem of model bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some MDPs, even slight model errors lead to a dramatic drop in performance, as illustrated in the beginning of the following video:\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Approximate Robust Control of Uncertain Dynamical Systems](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8khqd3BJo0A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8khqd3BJo0A)\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to address model bias belongs to the field of **Safe Reinforcement Learning**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### [The call of the void](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20call%20of%20the%20void)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will be accurate only on some region of the state space that was explored and covered in $D$.\n",
    "Outside of $D$, the model may diverge and **hallucinate** important rewards.\n",
    "This effect is problematic when the model is used by a planning algorithm, as the latter will try to **exploit** these hallucinated high rewards and will steer the agent towards **unknown** (and thus dangerous) **regions** where the model is erroneously optimistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational cost of planning\n",
    "\n",
    "At test time, the planning step typically requires **sampling a lot of trajectories** to find a near-optimal candidate, which may turn out to be very costly. This may be prohibitive in a high-frequency real-time setting. The **model-free** methods which directly recommend the best action are **much more efficient** in that regard."
